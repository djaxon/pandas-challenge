Heroes of Pymoli Observations:

1. Males dominate purchases and total purchase value, but females spend more per purchase. If I were a marketer or sales lead, I would market games in a package deal  to drive females to make more purchases and larger purchases.
2. As a marketer, the target market to achieve maximum purchases is 15-29, but age ranges where parents purchase games for kids (<10 years) or where adults (30-39) [who presumptively have more disposable income], spend more money on average per purchase than 15-29 year-olds.
3. Seems that the most popular games are also the most profitable from an item margin standpoint.
